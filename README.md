## Getting started

1. Install the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli) and log in to your store.
2. From the repository root, run `shopify theme serve` to start a local dev server.
3. Customize the theme within the Shopify editor:
   - Update brand fonts and colors in **Theme settings**.
   - Swap imagery, copy, and CTAs in the homepage sections.
   - Connect collections to the featured product grid.

Deploy the theme with `shopify theme push` once you're satisfied with the configuration.

## Static preview on GitHub Pages

The repository now includes a `/docs` directory containing a production-ready HTML preview that mirrors the default homepage sections (hero, feature tiles, featured products, team highlight, testimonials, newsletter, and footer) with representative content.

To publish the preview:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open **Settings â†’ Pages** in your GitHub project.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select your default branch (for example, `main`) and set the folder to `/docs`.
5. Save the configuration. GitHub Pages will deploy the static preview to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

You can customize the sample imagery and copy directly in `docs/index.html`. The preview reuses the theme's `assets/theme.css` and `assets/theme.js`, so any design refinements to the core theme automatically cascade to the hosted demo.
